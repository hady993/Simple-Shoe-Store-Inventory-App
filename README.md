# Build a Shoe Store Inventory App

> In this project, there were applied basic Android skills in building layouts and navigation files by building a simple Shoe Store app.

> This project consists of five screens:
	- Login screen: Email and password fields and labels plus login buttons.
	- Welcome onboarding screen.
	- Instructions onboarding screen.
	- Shoe Listing screen.
	- Shoe Detail screen for adding a new shoe.

## Getting Started

> While the login and onboarding pages will not do anything, the user will need to save the login state so that the login and onboarding pages do not show again.

> The shoe listing page will show the list of shoes and show a button for adding a new shoe, while the detail page will be for adding a shoe entry. All entries will be saved only as long as the app is running.

### Dependencies

> This app is working on Android versions from Android 5.1 (Lollipop) to Android 12 (API levels 31, 32).

> Gradle Versions:
	- Android Gradle Plugin Version: 4.0.1
	- Gradle Version: 6.1.1

### Installation

> I build and installed this app using Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 (Sep 2022).

> This app can be built and run successfully if the above dependencies are enabled.
